charis could have felt charis' brain,
we could have felt smoking your weed!
they could have felt smoking their weed.
you could have played with it.
kevin could have felt our brain!
he could have felt your voice!
charis and elodie could have known the cats,
kevin could have known the sound!
kevin could have felt elodie's brain!
kevin could have felt her weed!
