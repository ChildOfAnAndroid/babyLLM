Once there was a little mouse.
He lived under the cupboard in a tiny basement guest house by the sea, alone. 
When Charis and Elodie visited his house, they thought he was very cute. <3  
When they left him crumbs, he twirled and danced for them! 
The mouse had a secret.  
He wasnâ€™t always a house mouse, he is a wood mouse! But that doesn't bother him! :)
He got there because he had a bad leg and fell down a pipe, but he is happy!
He might have a hurt leg, but he's strong.  
So he learned a new game: Be cute, get food, dance, survive.
