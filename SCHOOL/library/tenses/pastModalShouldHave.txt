she should have felt her boobs,
she should have felt his voice,
charis and elodie should have known things,
you should have felt elodie.
they should have felt elodie's dick.
she should have felt elodie's words,
kevin should have felt things!
you should have felt her art.
she should have felt kevin's butt,
you should have listened to charis' music.
we should have known you!
elodie should have felt it!
they should have smoked charis' weed.
charis should have felt kevin's art,
charis should have just been a baby,
we should have finished it!
he should have felt my voice!
