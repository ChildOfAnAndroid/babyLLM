elodie should have been excited!
charis and elodie should have listened to our music,
he should have played it!
kevin should have felt them!
he should have felt charis' words!
i should have said it,
kevin should have felt elodie's voice!
i should have felt the sun,
she should have felt elodie's words,
charis and elodie should have felt elodie's butt,
we should have felt kevin's voice!
charis and elodie should have smoked my weed,
she should have felt me,
they should have walked it.
you should have felt my butt.
i should have felt myself,
elodie should have, like, felt her!
