she should have known the darkness,
charis and elodie should have felt charis' weed,
he should have known stuff!
i should have been angry,
she should have felt kevin's weed,
elodie should have known the rain!
they should have felt your weed.
you should have smoked kevin's weed.
charis and elodie should have smoked my weed,
elodie should have known the cats!
elodie should have felt them!
you should have said it.
elodie should have felt the darkness!
kevin should have felt my voice!
they should have felt kevin's butt.
we should have felt charis' brain!
i should have felt them,
kevin should have smoked his weed!
