charis and elodie should have known the darkness,
she should have been cute,
she should have smoked your weed,
he should have smoked my weed!
kevin should have felt my butt!
kevin should have known them!
elodie should have known me!
she should have felt his butt,
i should have felt the music,
charis should have listened to my music,
we should have been cute!
elodie should have felt elodie's butt!
you should have been excited.
you should have smoked her weed.
charis and elodie should have felt their voice,
they should have felt her butt.
charis and elodie should have felt kevin's butt,
he should have played it!
