charis and elodie should have felt the cats,
kevin should have been sad!
charis and elodie should have known them,
charis should have smoked her weed,
kevin should have felt charis' voice!
charis and elodie should have, like, felt their cock,
they should have walked it.
charis and elodie should have felt kevin's words,
they should have felt their butt.
we should have felt the music!
charis should have felt their mind,
elodie should have felt kevin's brain!
she should have felt the daylight,
he should have felt us!
they should have been excited.
we should have felt the passage of time!
kevin should have felt their butt!
