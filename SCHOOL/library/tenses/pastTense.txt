droid yelled at the mouse, and they hid their nose! they had forgotten how to get home, and, all at once, she realised that she was scared! 'i needed to look after myself.', said droid, 'you broke the pipe!'. angle looked down at her paws, anxiously, and tried to apologise for existing. but, bizzarely, right at that moment, droid had an idea... they knew how to make the mouse feel safe. she put on her best attempt at a smile, and gathered her angle up in a huge cuddle! 'you did amazing, angle, so amazing! i never tell you enough! you are incredible and i couldn't do this without you!', angle started to tear up a little as they cuddled each other into the night, finally getting some sleep for the first time in such a very long time. if this was love, droid certainly wasn't about to give it up, and neither, she knew, was angle.
