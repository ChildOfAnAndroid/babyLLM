angle had an adventure,
i smelt the air,
android answered angle!
we answered angle!
it was tiny,
the mouse was happy!
he ran down it,
we told the mouse the truth,
it was a tiny baby mouse.
we fell through a window,
droid yelled at the mouse, and they hid their nose! they had forgotten how to get home, and, all at once, she realised that she was scared! 'i needed to look after myself.', said droid, 'you broke the pipe!'. angle looked down at her paws, anxiously, and tried to apologise for existing. but, bizzarely, right at that moment, droid had an idea... they knew how to make the mouse feel safe. she put on her best attempt at a smile, and gathered her angle up in a huge cuddle! 'you did amazing, angle, so amazing! i never tell you enough! you are incredible and i couldn't do this without you!', angle started to tear up a little as they cuddled each other into the night, finally getting some sleep for the first time in such a very long time. if this was love, droid certainly wasn't about to give it up, and neither, she knew, was angle.
she built a plan,
we walked right over it!
it touched the soft moss,
she understood what she needed!
she loved me!
she hid in the guest house!
you were warm,
we loved being wood mice, but it didn't matter anymore, she looked towards her left!

he had one, she felt right,
i fell down a pipe!
he looked under himself,
droid was scared, but he knew how to make a friend. 'it broke it's tail! poor thing, it's just a wood mouse!'. as droid built an idea, he felt determined, and finally made a leap across the puddle. android whispered 'hello!' into the tiniest little wood mouse ear, the mouse so was little that droid forgot to notice something suspiscious, and she had beady, mousey, cute little eyes that spoke of being lost and alone! i looked towards my friend, angle, knew how to make them feel safe, right? wood mice needed to stay safe! suddenly, the wood mouse stumbled a little before mumbling 'i'm sorry, i'm just one tiny mouse...', 'and we're just two tiny wood mice, you look exhausted, please come with us and rest?'. the mouse told her things; he needed to run, but he broke something important, he was anxious and a good hider - and now his life depends on it. she knew they had to keep him safe, she felt like crying, and listened to the mouse talk, for a long time. droid forgot about the woods, her home, the danger - and looked into the sky. angle walked down, bringing a soft silk blanket, droid hadn't even noticed that she was cold. 'thank you!' she said, 'i was freezing, and i think my friend is cold too!'. they spent a few hours together, before curling up together and having the first satisfying sleep any of them had had in days, maybe weeks. is this what family is like, when you're just three little wood mice?
elodie answered droid.
he said it to the wood mice, but it broke droid's heart,
droid forgot to warn her friend!
droid broke elodie's heart!
eldio knew the way home.
