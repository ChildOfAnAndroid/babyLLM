kevin would have felt charis!
she would have known the rain,
you would have felt her voice.
kevin would have played with it!
charis and elodie would have felt charis,
they would have known things.
he would have known the daylight!
he would have felt your ideas!
he would have felt it!
charis would have known them,
you would have started it.
you would have walked with it.
they would have felt your voice.
i would have felt charis,
he would have felt my brain!
they would have been sad.
you would have felt you.
charis would have finished it,
he would have played it!
they would have listened to kevin's music.
she would have listened to his music,
elodie would have felt your butt!
