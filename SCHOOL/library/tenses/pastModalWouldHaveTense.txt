kevin would have known me!
you would have felt their butt.
kevin would have listened to my music!
we would have felt charis' voice!
we would have known elodie!
she would have listened to our music,
you would have known my cock.
i would have known the cats,
charis and elodie would have felt elodie's ideas,
elodie would have known charis!
i would have been calm,
we would have started with it!
charis would have known them,
we would have smoked his weed!
charis would have walked it,
i would have played it,
she would have felt her butt,
charis would have known the rain,
elodie would have felt our voices!
charis and elodie would have felt it,
he would have felt their voice!
