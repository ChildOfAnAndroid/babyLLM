she would have felt his butt,
we would have done it!
charis would have felt charis' butt,
i would have felt their voice,
kevin would have felt us!
she would have painted charis' picture,
you would have felt the passage of time.
kevin would have felt elodie!
charis would have been sad,
they would have felt elodie.
we would have felt her cock!
you would have felt the cats.
we would have felt charis!
he would have finished it!
i would have felt us,
you would have smoked his weed.
elodie would have felt the sound!
kevin would have felt them!
you would have felt his cock.
charis would have smoked kevin's weed,
we would have started it!
he would have smoked charis' weed!
