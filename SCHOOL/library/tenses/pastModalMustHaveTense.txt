kevin must have felt charis' brain!
charis must have known my dick,
he must have felt your weed!
elodie must have felt the music!
she must have felt the rain,
they must have started it.
charis must have felt charis,
elodie must have felt their cock!
you must have felt my brain.
charis and elodie must have said it,
charis and elodie must have known the daylight,
charis must have walked it,
charis and elodie must have smoked charis' weed,
she must have felt the passage of time,
i must have felt them,
