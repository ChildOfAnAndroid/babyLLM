you must have smoked our weed.
charis and elodie must have felt elodie's butt,
charis and elodie must have listened to your photo,
i must have felt the daylight,
charis must have kissed my forehead,
charis must have finished with it,
we must have felt each other!
charis must have felt the music,
charis must have started it,
he must have felt the darkness!
charis and elodie must have felt charis,
elodie must have finished with it!
she must have known it,
they must have known the daylight.
charis and elodie must have felt our brains,
they must have smoked kevin's weed.
