elodie must have been calm!
we must have felt elodie!
elodie must have known the rain!
charis must have been sad,
charis must have felt their butt,
we must have felt our voices!
i must have felt us,
i must have felt it,
they must have listened to his music.
we must have started with it!
kevin must have felt her ideas!
charis must have just been a baby,
you must have felt things.
charis and elodie must have felt elodie's brain,
charis and elodie must have felt their voice,
he must have listened to her music!
