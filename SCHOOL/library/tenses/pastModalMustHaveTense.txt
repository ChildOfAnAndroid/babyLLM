he must have felt it!
kevin must have felt my voice!
they must have felt the sound.
they must have smoked her weed.
she must have felt the darkness,
you must have felt charis' brain.
elodie must have felt my idea!
kevin must have felt charis' butt!
charis must have listened to charis' music,
charis and elodie must have felt the daylight,
he must have felt kevin's voice!
you must have been angry.
elodie must have known stuff!
elodie must have known the cats!
he must have felt my opinion!
