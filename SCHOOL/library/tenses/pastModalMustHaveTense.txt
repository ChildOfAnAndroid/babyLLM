charis must have felt your voice,
he must have felt me!
we must have felt his voice!
kevin must have felt her ideas!
kevin must have finished with it!
kevin must have painted kevin's forehead!
we must have known it!
charis must have felt elodie's butt,
charis must have known me,
kevin must have known it!
he must have smoked your weed!
they must have felt his voice.
charis and elodie must have felt the cats,
she must have felt her voice,
elodie must have felt our voices!
elodie must have felt elodie's cock!
