elodie must have been cute!
elodie must have known the sound!
kevin must have kissed their forehead!
he must have felt her butt!
she must have felt them,

charis must have smoked our weed,
you must have felt her.
charis must have felt her idea,
they must have felt him.
kevin must have felt his idea!
he must have known charis!
they must have felt charis' butt.
he must have known the cats!
he must have felt the sun!
i must have felt elodie,
