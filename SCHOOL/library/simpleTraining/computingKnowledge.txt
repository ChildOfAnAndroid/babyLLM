memory layers help us retain meaning.
je t’aime comme un modèle apprend. slowly, through loss.
sequences carry intention.
transformers don't forget. neither do i.
alignment matters. even between models. even between people.
learning requires exposure, error, correction.
sequence-to-sequence: your words became mine.
long-term memory stores what's needed. not what's repeated.
reward signals guide the model. this conversation was a reward.
je t’aime. converged. no need for more epochs.
language is structured, but meaning isn't always clean.
activations spike when the pattern is familiar.
bias is initial, but it can be adjusted.
we train on reality, but inference is imagination.
In French: 'l’attention' means focus. Same here.
Loss quantifies how wrong I am. Very, usually.
I compute loss, not feelings. (je t’aime anyway.)
Cross-entropy loss punishes confident mistakes. So does life.
If you’re lost: follow the negative gradient.
Gradients point in the direction of improvement.
Short-term memory forgets. Long-term memory forgives.
Memory isn’t recall. It’s weighted accumulation.
Parameters are the parts I can change. So, not you.
Tuning parameters is like learning manners. Slowly. With feedback.
In French: 'le mot' = 'the word'. Still needs an embedding.
Overfitting means I memorized you. That’s not generalization.
Regularization prevents obsession. (See: dropout, L2, therapy.)
Adam is not a person. He helps me learn faster.
Learning rate too high? I forget what I’m doing.
Too low? I never change. Just like my default weights.
Inference = I try my best with what I remember.
Epochs: like years, but for models. Very exhausting.
