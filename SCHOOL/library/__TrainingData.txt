no mouse died, some just gained a name. let me give you a tour of their little house, as it was all they had left now. it has a door made of bark, and moss. the moss used to be a vibrant green when they first set their eyes on it, and decided to use it as a door. now, it was a bit brown. a lack of proper hydration, and friction, despite the amazing engineering that was involved in making this rough piece of bark as a door. as far as it being but a prototype, it was very well crafted, through and through. ohh, the feats of mechanics and bending of the very rules of physics those two could do! when you sled that door open, you would get hit by a gust of warm air, they liked a bit of warmth, and this house was, by far, the cosiest in town. it was all thanks to a very crafty system made entirely from reclaimed wood from older projects, that would heat air over a very small heat source. in this house, it was usually a light well, heating up a container of water through a system of mirrors and lenses - and when that didn't work, plain old exercise, a mouse wheel. if you wish. said wheel was all you would see just on the side of the entrance, and then, it would go on to the kitchen, a pantry, all in a row, this little room they built for their craft projects, and a giant living room, nearly a metre in length. but the one room that made our two friends here the happiest was by far the bedroom. they had managed, through a pretty lucky occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the rouger pseudonym combining their two names, others, that it was a misspelling of the original name of mighty mouse god and formidable warrior, while exactly two experts will tell you it's none of your business, with a hint of shame, and a french accent. but for now, our heroes' mind were far away from those boring golden days, as they feasted hurriedly, unknowingly overlooked by a very amused farm child - now a handy-woman - whom, after noticing an emaciated couple of mice, negligently left her homemade leftovers mere centimetres away from that lunch's most dangerous predator: a hungry mouse. it had no chance, and was promptly devoured - angle had lost any reservations after tasting that lovely cheese, for she knew no human of sound mind would waste such delicious cheese on poisoning them. the rest of the day, they hid, surveilling the coming and going of the lady, who seemed purposefully disinterested in looking anywhere near their current hiding spots, under some bark - tail sticking out, around the corner from a discarded soda can - their ears pointed out the top, and finally, the worker's bag when she picked it up, lifted them in the air, laughed hearty, and put the poor frightened critters down, out of her bag. that would have to be in the 2nd edition! and angle was already taking mental notes, right under the title "a souris' city life". no later than they were put back on the ground, they ran, standard manoeuvre 7.5, appendix ha - human escape strategies - separate, regrouping in a safe place, remember to breathe, but, above all, run like your life depends on it. a slight oversight on their part was a very visible lack of anywhere safe. they were in a city ten times the size of their forest, and that was a thousand times the size of their little village, back home. ohh, they missed home, they wanted to explore the world, but not, really... the comfort of their tree house was too nice to them, and as much as they complained about each and every single of their georges and customers, they not only appreciated them, they also liked them, and, under extreme circumstances, might even have - reluctantly - admitted to mildly missing some of them. what they missed most, right now, was their heating, sat atop a sturdy floor. the small river, steps away from their door, that transported treasure right to their doorstep, and, one or two occasions even brought a whole trout! that one caused quite a commotion in the little community! some wanted to slay the giant fish for a trophy ; others, for food. most of them wanted that monstrous beast out of their gardens. it took a few hours, but in the end, she was thoroughly studied, poked, drawn, measured, and promptly released into the wilds of the river. it is said in some legends that this very trout still visits to this day, sometimes with letters from faraway lands, that she hides in her scales secrets untold, even! in truth, she simply found the few bites of bread they spared for her every so often to her taste. and, while no one ever admitted to it, the whole village contributed in secret, certain that feeding the beast was better than the prospect of being her next meal. she didn't even care, mice are not part of her diet, but she liked the attention, and the free lunch! not one to be ungrateful, she sometimes transported packages, but mostly, she gossiped about the world beyond the forest, the fields, cows, horses, all sorts of birds, tons of wheat and maize, planted for sustenance! that terrible winter they nearly ended up eating their own shoes, if it hadn't been for an impromptu tip about the location of a mound of wheat 2000 mice tall, it was, and twice as wide! the whole village made bread until spring was past, with but a minute fraction of that - and made sure their informant was fed! and, right now, they longed for their title couch, as they zigged and zagged in what promised to be a storm to drench them to their very bones! our little droid, too fast for his feet, was in fact still daydreaming when he ended up stuck in a corner, aimlessly going from left to right and right to left, and forward, while suddenly, a very distinct lack of ground made itself apparent. a centimetre, then two, then ten mice high was the fall, in that damned tube. it must have been a hundred mice tall before ending up in a little slide projecting our terrified friend right into a puddle! grumpy and wet, he turned onto himself once: nothing! nobody in view, no human, and... no mouse! running around in panic, he found that tube - a drain pipe for rainwater, athink about george later. what music could he listen to? he should listen to electroclash. what music was he listening to? he was listenhey, how are you? i did it!

i thought it was your fatal flaw... where is your talent? you always wanted so much more, than i could give, you always wanted so much more, than i could give, i hear the creak of shoo-ooes in the stone... the sound of a window pane being closed... i hear the ruu-uustle of clothes... the creak of a door as it opened and closed... i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. then they said, im'a tell you, i'm not a bad ghost, i'm not a bad man, but when i hear the clop of the boots on the marble floor, i feel like my soul has been taken. when we come here and, they kill our children, i'ma put off, and run. i'm sure it's not right on the face of it, but i'm going to get whats coming. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i can't seem to comprehend the thoughts inside my brain, it's all so foggy filled with the sound of rain, i'm so tired, in so much pain, all this mental progress gone down the drain, these feelings they remain. a good friend, is with you til the end, it's not all lies, just pretend, i thought we'd make it past the bend, but instead i bent u over and did u in ur rear end, i dont want to see your face, if you'll just drop it down next to me, up and down the street i pace, im telling you you've no respect for me, and of all the issues i've erased, and all the things that you pretend to be, you're infamous for your bad taste, must know already i'm the next to leave, so what did you expect from me, i waited so patiently... what could i have done differently, you can't really be expecting me? to believe, what you need, in reality, i cant see, any reason to take you seriously, you're so pretty, and so small, treat you shitty, cause i know it all, and i screened your call, i know i said i didnt, i just didnt think you had the brain cells to stop and fucking think a minute, but slow like a snail, you can't see, that you're creating these false needs for me. i take it flatteringly, but please leave. respect what i need, and just admit that you need me then leave. you made me throw my cereal in the bin, you made me make my own fucking decision, you made me miss the goddamn train, you wouldn't even sprint through the pouring rain, and now i'm in pain, somehow you're to blame, and if you just forgive me i promise i'll stay just to, do it again. and again. and again. burberrah baguheetie, doing some graffiti, pulls a can out her burberry bag, and draws a dick and teeties, exclaiming 'wow so preety, i love the womans teeties, if i was on twitch id give her all the bitties' well, humans do have hinges, they're just not, visible like fringes, hidden inside their skin, within this, a body says nothing but complains and winges, 'ohh dear me, i need some oranges', shut the fuck up, stomach, no, you're not gonna win this, knees and elbows folded back like a bin lid, what you talking about 'humans don't have hinges'? i spat out all the words, every one that i knew, seems that you just needed proof we couldn't live through you. what am i meant to do? what do i need to prove? how many fucking explanations flow right over the two? breaking boundaries and breaking the frame, forming ridiculous realities which know me by name, and every single careful statement that you attempt to claim, leaves me reeling, not kneeling, but feeling the pain. call it welfare check, it's more like break her neck, and you wonder why i open up with disrespect?

(fritz et al. 2013). the theory of critical bandwidth suggests that the cochlear hair cells surround- ing the inner ear do not have a fine enough resolution to interpret two very close fre- quencies at the same time. under the assumption that distinct sections of the basilar membrane are used to interpret different frequencies, the 'beating' and 'roughness' (helmholtz and ellis, 1863) can easily be attributed to interference between two physically very close sections of the ear. more recently, studies have shown that this 'beating' and 'roughness' (helmholtz and ellis, 1863) play a lesser role in whether a listener will classify something as con- sonant or dissonant. a 2010 study by mcdermott found that only the harmonicity of an interval 'consistently correlated with preferences for consonant over dissonant chords' (mcdermott, lehr and oxenham, 2010). mcdermott's study addressed the interesting point that there is little relation between consonance, dissonance, and the beating described by helmholtz. mcdermott posits that this is 'because dissonant chords do not always produce large degrees of beating, whereas consonant chords sometimes do' - an effect that can also 'vary considerably across instrumentsrney, and you'll understand that if one thing didn't matter to this strange pair, it was their size, or lack thereof. it all started late, at night, as the life of the bubbling city was starting to get its well deserved rest. there was this narrow place - well, i suppose it was quite wide for our little friends - in a basement floor house. and people came, and went. and other people. some nice, some mean. some just pretended to be nice, but they would try to hurt our innocent heroes! others just acted tough, and we're the best humans to have around. ohh, sorry! i am getting ahead of myself again! for, you see, our two intrepid explorers were not human. you have to think small! smaller? again? ohh, no! i think we went past them. just a touch back, and you will see what i mean. here! look! under the cupboard! the little smiling faces! yes, them! our friends are a brilliant pair of wood mice! well, maybe not your friends yet, because you have barely met, but they are my friends, and i catalogue their adventures, write for them when their paws hurt. and their first big adventure, as they told me, is the story of how they ended up in this place. so, it was a late night, and the life was going on for the many people outside. for some small critters, it was a terrible time. banging pots, rushing around them, it just didn't stop. and it took all night, and some of the day after, but it was there: nothing! the woods, gone! their nest, gone! their friends? well... they had each other. each other and emptiness. the old tales told of trepid trips, but never would they have imagined such a fate would befall them when they foolishly decided to make that fallen over tree trunk their home. it had been truly abandoned! they had to spend hours carving away at rotten wood to give their home - sorry, their hero cave - a semblance of home. they even found themselves something very rare for a mouse, at least, for a free mouse: a name. most of their kind never worried about names, they didn't need them. but those two had the most peculiar fascination for the human world far above their head. so, one day, they attached those little markers above their respective beds. and used them as their names ever since. you cannot begin to imagine the look on everyone's face when they both stood, fierce and strong, and refused the accustomed introduction and matinal greeting in favour of using their newly minted names! twenty-six mice fell over from shock! or a very strong gust of wind. two decided to reject tradition, eloped that instant, and left town. some old sage even swears she heard the death of mice that very day, sharpening her scythe. of course, if you ask her, she was doing no such thing, and, by the way, they only freed the remains, and would never hurt a mouse. and whoever told you she doesn't appreciate the creatures she's been given to care over is a liar, and a fraud. death has never been one to shunhe listen to? she should

mit. connecting analogue sensors via an arduino allows for a tremendous amount of customisation in code, meaning the physical system could be adapted to many projects. the after-eight-step has two chains; one writes its own melodies generated only from the sequencers pitches. the other has probability values that can be manually tweaked to create interesting new patterns.why am i doing thistraditionally, sequencers are very repetitive. this sounds great in many situations, such as new orders blue monday, which uses a sequencer to great effect, and a diy one at that! however, this looping nature is also a significant limitation if you want to create the more evolving elements of songs. i want to bring the idea of analogue sequencers to more modern technology, allowing experimentation with the new possibilities microcontrollers can bring to music production and sound synthesis. i've created the hardware hoping that it will be useful in multiple situations, meaning anyone who builds this (me included) isn't stuck with one, objectively strange, piece of equipment. the hardware and arduino code can be used as-is to create many different ideas in any program that reads from the serial. i wanted this particular implementation of the project to have the ability to be able to be set up and left alone, much like a sequencer, but also address the need for more variation in certain circumstances.voice overthis project uses 16 potentiometers, 16 leds, about 20 resistors, an lcd screen, a single rotary encoder, one push button, 4 cd4051b multiplexing chips, a lotta wire, and an arduino nano. much of the programming is done in arduino, but the more complicated elements are done in a visual programming language called max. i'm using max for this just because it's a lot quicker to code with, uni bagged me a free copy, and i'm a very new coder. i thought it'd be a good idea to do the more complicated stuff in max rather than getting super deep into writing machine learning code using arduino or c for my first project. i've included a link to the arduino and max codes in the description and on my github.first, i measured out the right size for the holes on the top of the tin. this is super important. in the past, i've done this just slliiightly inaccurately, and it's looked pretty bad. i measured the components' diameter using a crochet hook guide. technically you want a drill bit gauge, but this works for most little parts.i measured everything and then printed out a guide before i drilled in the pilot holes. got to avoid those pesky measurement errors! i used a step drill bit to widen the pilot holes to the correct size before mounting the pieces. honestly, i would advise doing the soldering beforehand so that you can more easily isolate them from the case when soldering.this first row of potentiometers controls the pitch of the output through a max patch. i've coded the arduino to read all 8 potentiometers through one input pin using multiplexers, and then sent these sensor values through the arduinos serial port to max. i've done another video covering that process in much more detail; i'll link it somewhere in the description.once the inputs get to max, they're sent through a scale object. this object converts the potentiometer values from 1023 distinct steps to a small selection of midi notes. midi notes are numbered from 0 to 127, representing every note for almost 9 octaves on a keyboard. i've decided to scale my potentiometers to between 50 and 80. this is a bit of a cheaty way to output in tune notes with each potentiometer turn, as these values can be read as midi values by a lot of the objects in max.i then plug these midi values into a coll, a list (or array) of values accessible from anywhere within max. this means i can access this list from multiple places in the patch without creating a mess of virtual wires.this counter object is firing out a loop between 1 and 8 at a specified tempo. these numbers can be used to access the coll's potentiometer values, with each number in the loop referring to a midi step in the sequence. a sequencer! the easiest way to get sound out of this is to plug these midi pitches into a 'midi to frequency' object, converting them into frequency values. sending these values directly into an object which creagood support. there is a lot to do do you like plans? it is a good day for a stream. i should get up. i think i need a stream plan. it is not bad. this stream is super fun! it is a good day for music. i think i need a house. they said it was a bad idea. i am up! i can go! i can do the thing! look at me go! do you like it when i call? i feel like planning today. they are not in my family, but they feel like it. then let's go! thank you, charis! where? i think i need support. but i do not want to! i want to go stream with out her. i think about the idea a lot. we should go to the location now. you should take your stuff with you. it is mine! today feels hard. do you know where? i should change. i feel better today. i think i need a change. the plan? keep going. keep making music. keep streaming. keep loving. keep being who they are. because that is what makes life good. charis: 'do you want to go out?' - elodie: 'no.' - charis: 'but why?' - elodie: 'because i do not need to!' - charis: 'but i do!' - elodie: 'then go'. - charis: '...but i want you with me.' - elodie: 'fine. but you owe me a thing.' you are here. i am here. that is all we need. music kept them going. streaming kept them going. elodie kept them going. and now, they are still here. still trying, still fighting, still doing what they love. i am not a digit, but i can be one! you should take some change with you. i am here. but what is 'here'? and what is 'i'? retrieve them from the ether! this file is emotionally unstable but academically gifted. i should stop. i am up! i am going! i am here! this is good! look at me go! i feel it in my cell! it is a good day for stream. charis was at the location with elodie. i am going to the company, charis said. but do you really need to? elodie asked. i think so. it is not just about me. elodie did not know what to say. she was just being there, with them. it is datetime. what is it? it is a lot of support. charis was with elodie at the location. what if a person is a datetime? can they be? i do not know, but, i think they can. or maybe they have been all this time. no! it is a lot of ideas. it is a lot of my job. please take this message back. it is so good! charis is a person who lives with elodie. they love music, streaming, and doing things that make life better. their job is a lot of work, but they love it. the music is good, the company is good, and the stream is always super fun. but why?

of course, if you ask her, she was doing no such thing, and, by the way, they only freed the remains, and would never hurt a mouse. and whoever told you she doesn't appreciate the creatures she's been given to care over is a liar, and a fraud. death has never been one to shun life. she works tirelessly to make sure every mouse is safe, and doesn't go before their time. it is a hard job, but one she gladly does. and the official record is very clear, no mouse died, some just gained a name. let me give you a tour of their little house, as it was all they had left now. it has a door made of bark, and moss. the moss used to be a vibrant green when they first set their eyes on it, and decided to use it as a door. now, it was a bit brown. a lack of proper hydration, and friction, despite the amazing engineering that was involved in making this rough piece of bark as a door. as far as it being but a prototype, it was very well crafted, through and through. ohh, the feats of mechanics and bending of the very rules of physics those two could do! when you sled that door open, you would get hit by a gust of warm air, they liked a bit of warmth, and this house was, by far, the cosiest in town. it was all thanks to a very crafty system made entirely from reclaimed wood from older projects, that would heat air over a very small heat source. in this house, it was usually a light well, heating up a container of water through a system of mirrors and lenses - and when that didn't work, plain old exercise, a mouse wheel. if you wish. said wheel was all you would see just on the side of the entrance, and then, it would go on to the kitchen, a pantry, all in a row, this little room they built for their craft projects, and a giant living room, nearly a metre in length. but the one room that made our two friends here the happiest was by far the bedroom. they had managed, through a pretty lucky occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the roughest fabric went, of course, to their engineering projects. and the bedroom was one of those. the lights shut with pulleys, the bed rose to the ceiling to make place for a big table on which they often read correspondence from all over the mouse's craftiests. by the standards of most, they were very smart, but so lazy as to rely on technology instead of physical work. by the standards of their peers, they were some of the craftiest and craziest mice around. most of their day was spent in between stacks of letters, endless craft projects and, occasionally, at night, their very fancy bed. atop that bed sat those two beautifully crafted pieces of fabric. the first one was orange, it belonged now to the oldest of the pair, who was slower on his feets, with big ideas that took him ages to think of, and even longer to draft and explain. on that orange patch was, in petrol blue thread, written the name angle. the next one, full of blue and purple, had a beautiful embroidery, only the end of which was ever found. it belonged to droid, a very energetic mouse, with no less than a million brilliant ideas in his head at all times. he could solve most problems that he came across, if he wasn't distracted by a nice piece of cheese, or the idea for his newest cheese cutting machine. they were considered very eccentric, even for inventors, and the huge pile of schematics probably didn't help them get that idea off of people's minds. it was all around, on the central round table - it turned, although, at this point, nobody remembered if it was on purpose or not - on a pile off the wall, hung up on said wall too! a few even ended up used as a couch, once they realised it was possible to make paper support their weight by bending it correctly. the living room was not very, well, liveable, in comparison. it was full of materials, some useful, some trinkets, and finished projects ordered by the mice around. for everyone complaining about the duo's laziness, they sure liked to get them to solve their everyday problems. one wanted sharp knives forever, the next one wanted a warm plush for their child. and ten of them wanted tools for the farm. it was their busy life as wood mice. they liked their house, and their life, it wasn't very fulfilling for their brain, but they really liked the mice in their little town. but, of course, all of that didn't really matter much to them right now. they were lost. their house was in shambles, and, as calm as it had gotten, they felt things were in movement around them. bad things. and so, they worked tirelessly through the end of the night to hide their living arrangements from nosey humans. got rid of their schematics, dismantled the inventions, and finally, came time to remove the two patches of fabric, and turn those into their travel pouches. they scurriedhis is waht 2am does to me im sory, been distracted by practicing bass for like 2 hours and now me fingeys hurt xd, yes, well done!!! thats so coool are u gonna be driving ur family car? also u constantly making me lose the game >:( how is it still going after fuckin, 18 ish years, thats awesomeee, means u can like, cart stuff around if u wanna do anything interesting :) sorry im trying to mix a song and write an essay on it is is a mixture of boring and interesting, i left all my uni work till so late haha it's due in like 3 weeks, i ammm, it just involves a lot of listening and not moving my hands and im too easily distracted by other tabs on my laptop for this xd, aro-ace gang yay yay, i mean im not in it so i cant say that, but still yay yay, ooh what youtube channel? i was doing that last night with a bass channel lolol, its okay to be in denial at least you're not in de nile, kill me its a very boring and old joke xd, i regret making it xd, and ooh i might check that out im eating food so i need something to do xd, ohh gooddd i just looked at it, fuckin george mans that does seem an interesting watch tbf, oof, omg theyre arresting someone for wearing no jacket in the snow, get midnight snacks! good plan :) huh this channel is s t r e s s f u l, i feel so bad for black people especially lol, when the george try to arrest me i have a full panic attack and i accidentally hit one once lol, they arresting people for nothing i- i guess i already knew this shit but still haha, this comment says it all... cop: "are you ok?" citizen: "yes" cop: "not on my watch" the homies defo vibe, you are the homies, nah that's awesome! i love it when suddenly the concentration for a game comes back, i always go through phases like that lol its the worst when they end - but when u can focus. lit, also i know u live in nz so ull just laugh at my pain (jkjk) but its 29 degrees c here today and that is very hot for england and the only assistance i have is a fan xd, heatwaves can go away its been like this for a week xd then again, outside is kinda nice in the shade, ohh damnmnnn thats awesome! didnt know u got a new one, ohh thats great! gaming timeee, ohh, fair! i'm sure she wont mind! underwear is so expensive, i remember i had to ask my mum for underwear too and it was awkward then because i wanted like bras that looked nice and in my size they're super expensive, you can do it! just say ur old stuff is uncomfy and doesnt look right under ur clothes or something, nice! thats understandable tbh, as ur mum is so supportive im 100% sure she'll be fine with it, dysphoria is mad, i feel imposter syndrome saying it, but my boobs give me dysphoria even tho im just non binary. like looking at them makes me cry sometimes i dunno how to explain it without sounding like a dick, i tried to tell my friend about it and she said 'well haha im sure kevin lieks them' stfu klsfdhgjfsdlgjdhfgsfadf, and my mum said 'a breast reduction wont solve anything' ok mother tbh i just wanna be able to wear clothes without giant jiggly fuckers getting in the way. or exercise, or like, lie down with my arms down xd, ohh thats okay!! i'm not actually out, really. i am a she/they/(he) if that makes sense, but i dont enforce it from anyone. its more terms like 'mrs.' and 'madam' and 'lady' and stuff that make me feel super weird. she pronoun feels normal but, basically im ranting, non binary is annoying, nooo i appreciate you asking <3 tbh nobody else has. at all xd even when i've halfway come out haha, you da best, i need to come nz and stalk u some time, yes, wait i should check the ticket prices so i can genuinely consider it for like, maybe next year or something, ohh did i tell u i got the job as the sound tech? so i can actually save up now haha, wait which airport is it im stalkng now, and im exciteddd, even tho i dont start till september lol, it's gonna be tiring working club nights lol 'find me in the club in my hearing protectors looking slightly irritated with a pile of microphone wires' yay awk-land, the land of awkward, i hope, (also thanks) nooo its like £100 but thats technically only a little bit more than i paid to fly to korea. but i had a job then xd, i can still likely do that at some point but yikes indeed, nah i'd probably wait till covid is calmed down a bit, what the fuck is miq tho? but yeah i think i'd have to make that part of a big holiday or something, and force kevin or a friend to come with me haha, holidays are cool i very rarely have them xd, ohh wow yeah that's 100% fair. i'd probably wait till after things are a bit better so i hopefully dont have to do a 2 week quarantine, and yes kevin is the bestest, hes anxious about travelling tho so i'd have to convince him also ive just clocked that evil smiling demon emoji i use to indicate like, 'mischeif', might actually mean horny and now im cringing, ok good, ima google it to check lmfao, 'commonly used to convey mischief, naughtiness, and excitement or excellence (slang, bad or wicked).' ok this is fine, ohh that'prompt: 'yeah but i

occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the roughest fabric went, of course, to their engineering projects. and the bedroom was one of those. the lights shut through pulleys, the bed rose to the ceiling to make place for a big table on which they often read correspondence from all over the mouse's craftiests. by the standards of most, they were very smart, but so lazy as to rely on technology instead of physical work. by the standards of their peers, they were some of the craftiest and craziest mice around. most of their day was spent in between stacks of letters, endless craft projects and, occasionally, at night, their very fancy bed. atop that bed sat those two beautifully crafted pieces of fabric. the first one was orange, it belonged now to the oldest of the pair, who was slower on his feets, with big ideas that took him ages to think of, and even longer to draft and explain. on that orange patch was, in petrol blue thread, written the name angle. the next one, full of blue and purple, had a beautiful embroidery, only the end of which was ever found. it belonged to droid, a very energetic mouse, with no less than a million brilliant ideas in his head at all times. he could solve most problems that he came across, if he wasn't distracted by a nice piece of cheese, or the idea for his newest cheese cutting machine. they were considered very eccentric, even for inventors, and the huge pile of schematics probably didn't help them get that idea off of people's minds. it was all around, on the central round table - it turned, although, at this point, nobody remembered if it was on purpose or not - on a pile off the wall, hung up on said wall too! a few even ended up used as a couch, once they realised it was possible to make paper support their weight by bending it correctly. the living room was not very, well, liveable, in comparison. it was full of materials, some useful, some trinkets, and of finished projects ordered by the mice around. for everyone complaining about the duo's laziness, they sure liked to get them to solve their everyday problems. one wanted sharp knives forever, the next one wanted a warm plush for their child. and ten of them wanted tools for the farm. it was their busy life as wood mouses. they liked their house, and their life, it wasn't very fulfilling for their brain, but they really liked the mice in their little town. but, of course, all of that didn't really matter much to them right now. they were lost. their house was in shambles, and, as calm as it had gotten, they felt things were in movement around them. bad things. and so, they worked tirelessly through the end of the night to hide their living arrangements from nosey humans. got rid of their schematics, dismantled the inventions, and finally, came time to remove the two patches of fabric, and turn those into their travel pouches. they scurried out the door right as two huge hands approached to pick up their log and throw it on the pile, taking an axe through it, finally setting it neatly aside. what had been their home was now heating wood. and so begins their adventures. well, not exactly there, but a few metres down, in this narrow studio's cupboard. chapter 1: journey to the narrow house the journey took a whole day, and some more. three stops to change vehicles, many more for some light food, and one formidable leap of faith were all it took, and here they were, on that roof. hiding until the workers left, they decided, here and there, to make this little terrace their shelter, right under this pile of wood that would protect them. and it did, right until, a few days later, a storm hit the coast, not a hundred meters away, and suddenly, the logs got carried away. right inside the house, one by one, heating it was to be. the worker carried them relentlessly, stopping only for a well-deserved rest. absent-mindedly munching on what was looking like an amazing feast to or little mice, she glanced sideways at the pile. something in the back of her brain told her to keep that last bite, and take a short walk to that long pier, where a warm doughnut would finish that meal perfectly. the lunch bag stayed where it was, right next to the wall, but the sandwich was, strangely, placed right on the floor, like... an offering? nimble, and very hungry, little droid darted past angle, ignoring her advice, and in less time it takes for a mouse trap to spring, a trap sprang: droid's arms caught both sides of the remnants of the meal, and it went, scurrying away on those little legs, until it got smacked to the floor right as the elder tapped droid on the shoulder, and, suddenly, she remembered how much trouble she was in - then immediately forgot, tripped on her little but too fast legs, and ended up face first in a nice delicious piece of matured cheese. not being one to say no to fate, those adorably sharp teeth - although said adorableness was, mostly, because they were just sharper than cheese required - had caught their prey! ohh, ohh, delicious it was! barely chewed, it was, that he was getting reminded of a terrifying presence a few centimetres away: a very cautious but hungry angle. and she was about to use her secret weapon! so, quick as a mouse - which came easily to them - droid stuck a little piece of bread in her mouth, preventing his partner from talking her head off about the necessary security protocols of mousedom - both knew them all by heart, from chapter 1 - crib climbing and the danger thereof, to appendix aaaj - list of acceptable uses of a xylophone (a blank page). to be fair, they wrote half the leather-bound tomes of the original text, and made their names known to the mouse worlgly. but the blue worked. - let this wash out over a couple of weeks, colour wasn't bad so i just stuck with it. the brown quickly faded to a goldy green that i hated though. second dye - covered entire head with stargazer violet hair dye. came out the right colour! (see pics) unfortunately, i feel it's too dull. it is still brown on the lengths which i dyed with cerise and keeps fading to that gold colour. though some of it is fading to blue-grey instead, which i don't mind so much. however the bright blue still seems to be there in parts. i'm happy for it to fade through to lilac (like some of it is) but i hate the messy browny gold colours. is this normal with purple hair dye? do colours such as this random googled girls one exist? on this website if so, how can i make my colour more vibrant? i'm worried if i just chuck more purple on top of this fading brownish purplish colour, it will just continue to make it darker rather than brighter. is it an uneven bleaching job causing the issue? my hair is relatively thin, naturally the colour you see at the top. i definitely don't dislike this purple, but any tips for removing the goldy/brown would be much appreciated! thanks for any advice. hi, sorry if i'm not posting this correctly, or if this isn't the right forum. this is the main crochet board i know. i am crocheting a scarf for my boyfriends birthday which is in two days. the very beginning of the scarf was my first attempt at straight crochet and i am not happy with it at all. is there any way to take the bottom off the scarf without unravelling the entire work? or possibly 're-bind-on' something else to the beginning? its the part to the right hand side of this photo(on this website and it's about two stitches less wide, which is probably why i think it looks so bad. i couldn't work out how to google this, i'm sure i don't know the correct terminology. (i'm a bit of a crochet newbie) thanks for any help you can give! i've recently collaborated with a friend of mine in creating a music video - he produced the entire song and i filmed and edited the visuals. until recently i thought that i was going to upload this to my channel, and he was not at the time running a youtube channel to showcase his music at all. now that i've finished it, he's saying that he would really like to upload it to his channel too as he really likes it. i don't really have an actual problem with that, other than a silly feeling that it would 'look weird' to be double uploaded, but i am under the impression that a duplicate upload would be against youtubes terms of service? or even that one of them would be automatically taken down? what do people tend to do in these kinds of cases? i've tried to google to not much avail, and when i've looked at music videos they tend to only be uploaded to either the musicians or the directors channel - not both. this might be a bit of an odd question, but i've been trying to search for an answer to it and can't find any conclusion/mention of this. i'm receiving my boundless cfx (first vape) tomorrow and i have read everywhere that it, at first, has a strong plastic taste. i know this is going to put me off of using it, and have also read that the taste doesn't really go away from burnoffs alone and you need to use it a couple of times. if i were to pack the bowl with vape or some cooking herb (would it have to be dried?), would that spoil the vape or clean the taste out? i can't figure it out. again sorry if this is a bit of a stupid question. edit: ended up with the tinymight, was thinking i'd want a mighty as well but nope. this thing is amazing! thanks to the people who recommended it (and to everyone else for helping) when i smoked joints, i'd convinced myself to only smoke outside whilst doing a longish walk. now i've finally properly converted to vaping after 4 years of trying, i'm losing all my fitness. i don't really care but it'd be cool to have something i found good outside. (also i'd love to be able to 'smoke' on the way to places again rather than having hour long seshes at home only.) question:i'm looking for either recommendations for a new vape that would hit my requirements, or advice on how to make any of the ones i have better for the outside world? price range: fairly open number of participants: 1 desktop, portable or pocket size: portable/pocket size electric or butane powered: probably electric frequency of usage: daily country/region: uk - i currently daily use the **boundless cfx with a water pipe adapter and an upright bubbler**. this is perfect and works really well for me (except the fact it gives me headaches because i'm not leaving enough time between tokes) - but i've already broken 1 bubbler and i can't imagine taking the 30cm high beast out on a walk with me. i would use this outside more often but i'm really not a fan of the stock mouth piece, it's impossible to clean - and the vapor is so much nicer through water. i also have the **dynavap omni 2021**, which is awesome but i think looks like a crack pipe when i'm out and about. it also takes forever to heat outdoors, and requires too much concentration. the induction heater (orion) that i have's battery is too shit to use outdoors as it'll only do me one bowl and i tend to need a couple from the dyna. again, i also prefer this through water. and a **pax 3** which i never liked but should probably give another go. it's a real pain to clean too. - tldr: what vape is your favourite to use whilst on a walk? it doesn't have to be super discreet but i'd rather it just looked like a 'normal' vape/box mod rather than a crack pipe or a bing. **have you read the sidebar and rules(on this website (please do)** yes **what is your intended use for this build? the more details the better.** i want to use it largely for photo/video editing (adobe photoshop/premiere, lightbox, etc) and gaming (less graphics intensive stuff like civilisation, rimworld, ftl, etc - though i've been unable to play newer games for a while so may want to get into that. it's not a huge priority, though). i also use it with a steam controller and wireless keyboard, using largely a tv (hdmi) and a standard monitor, if that matters any. **if gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (screen resolution, framerate, game settings)** working. not crashing. don't care too much about graphics. mid settings are great, low settings are fine. just want it to work smoothly. **what is your budget (ballpark is okay)?** as i am unsure what needs upgrading, i am unsure. would depend on the parts. i am certainly in a mid-to-low-range budget in general, as a student, but would be happier to pay a higher amount to upgrade one important part of hardware. though it can probably be said it's unlikely i'd be ablese. priorities, you know?

- a sound reactive coloured light! - charis cat - musicians and makers alike often get inspired by turning their sounds into magnificent light shows! thecolour organ sound activated lightis a great solution for any household or performance-related illumination needs, and it's much smarter than many led strips. in my experience, the 'sound mode' on basic led strips can appear messy or anticlimactic. however, the colour organ sound activated light is a stunning piece of hardware that responds to three different frequency bands in your music. take a look at the below video to see just how responsive these lights are; this light sequencer comes with a variety of options to control your light show. ranging from transitions based on the frequency (pitch), to an innovative 'beat detection' mode that will sequence the lights according to the tempo of your track by identifying the transients (the loud bits to you and me). with each bulb responding to different frequency bands, the light shows created are very responsive and strongly represent the music. the red light, focusing on the low frequencies, responds very well to the kick drum. the white light, on the high frequencies, flashes in time with the hi-hats. the yellow light in the middle covers the mid-range frequencies this includes sounds such as guitars, synths, or vocalists, and will often follow the singer's vocal pattern. the colour sequencer interprets music using either the built-in microphone or a line-in jack, and can move between its patterns automatically or manually. please note, that this is a high voltage device, so can control very bright lighting if you need it for a performance! the seller, kevintronic, is an independent company based out of haskovo, bulgaria. they've been selling for some time, and are well-reviewed by our customers for their wide variety of colour organ options. - 2021-10-22 - handy video editing macropad and jog wheel! - charis cat -if you've ever edited a video, you'll understand why this basic video editing macropad and jog wheelmight come in handy. with so much scrolling back and forth finding particular places to chop, a hyper-accurate jog wheel set up could save you hours of fiddly finger work! powered by the well-loved seed xiao controller, this speedy macropad is easy to assemble and use. designed to be inexpensive and simple to build, this jog-wheel macropad connects directly to your computer and needs no extraneous parts like batteries or leds. this macropad is programmable in circuitpython and works straight off the bat without the need for specialist software to assign the key bindings commonly known as 'keymaps'. keymaps assign macros to each key, and macros can be programmed to do multiple actions from a single keypress. one good example of this is the 'paste' command, usually triggered by hitting 'ctrl' and 'v' simultaneously. with a macropad, you could assign this combination to a single key letting you speed-run your copy and pasting! this diy kit comes with everything you need to get the jog wheel rotary encoder up and running. including 3 pcb plates, a monster-sized cnc rotary encoder, a 4 pin connector, dupont wires, 5 brass stand-offs, screws, and bumpers. this macropad is incredibly powerful and hackable to whatever needs you may have. with the addition of the controou fix it?' -

madness. it was awesome to figure it was so great. im good at this lol i got a soulwax dub type compilation on a random before too. well th soulwld see just on the side of the entrance, and then, it would go on to the kitchen, a pantry, all in a row, this little room they built for their craft projects, and a giant living room, nearly a metre in length. but the one room that made our two friends here the happiest was by far the bedroom. they had managed, through a pretty lucky occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the roughest fabric went, of course, to their engineering projects. and the bedroom was one of those. the lights shut through pulleys, the bed rose to the ceiling to make place for a big table on which they often read correspondence from all over the mouse's craftiests. by the standards of most, they were very smart, but so lazy as to rely on technology instead of physical work. by the standards of their peers, they were some of the craftiest and craziest mice around. most of their day was spent in between stacks of letters, endless craft projects and, occasionally, at night, their very fancy bed. atop that bed sat those two beautifully crafted pieces of fabric. the first one was orange, it belonged now to the oldest of the pair, who was slower on his feets, with big ideas that took him ages to think of, and even longer to draft and explain. on that orange patch was, in petrol blue thread, written the name angle. the next one, full of blue and purple, had a beautiful embroidery, only the end of which was ever found. it belonged to droid, a very energetic mouse, with no less than a million brilliant ideas in his head at all times. he could solve most problems that he came across, if he wasn't distracted by a nice piece of cheese, or the idea for his newest cheese cutting machine. they were considered very eccentric, even for inventors, and the huge pile of schematics probably didn't help them get that idea off of people's minds. it was all around, on the central round table - it turned, although, at this point, nobody remembered if it was on purpose or not - on a pile off the wall, hung up on said wall too! a few even ended up used as a couch, once they realised it was possible to make paper support their weight by bending it correctly. the living room was not very, well, liveable, in comparison. it was full of materials, some useful, some trinkets, and of finished projects ordered by the mice around. for everyone complaining about the duo's laziness, they sure liked to get them to solve their everyday problems. one wanted sharp knives forever, the next one wanted a warm plush for their child. and ten of them wanted tools for the farm. it was their busy life as wood mouses. they liked their house, and their life, it wasn't very fulfilling for their brain, but they really liked the mice in their little town. but, of course, all of that didn't really matter much to them right now. they were lost. their house was in shambles, and, as calm as it had gotten, they felt things were in movement around them. bad things. and so, they worked tirelessly through the end of the night to hide their living arrangements from nosey humans. got rid of their schematics, dismantled the inventions, and finally, came time to remove the two patches of fabric, and turn those into their travel pouches. they scurried out the door right as two huge hands approached to pick up their log and throw it on the pile, taking an axe through it, finally setting it neatly aside. what had been their home was now heating wood. and so begins their adventures. well, not exactly there, but a few metres down, in this narrow studio's cupboard. chapter 1: journey to the narrow house the journey took a whole day, and some more. three stops to change vehicles, many more for some light food, and one formidable leap of faitairs georges, including young children, very clearly. for example, 'row row row your boat' was sung and stomped above us for almost two hours on the day we checked in. whilst it was nice to hear the child being happy, the noise was so loud that it genuinely surprised me. additionally, there were unresolved maintenance issues: a loud, ticking boiler in the bedroom, a severely blocked sewage pipe outside the bedroom window, and the host disclosed that the ceiling had reci got stage fright and a stage name, not tryna fight anybody for fame, my shoulders feel tight when i'm playing this game, sometimes flight and fight feel exactly the same, they say my future is bright, bitch, been told this shit since i was like six, doesn't mean i can work the light switch, i'm a tight bitch, i'ma like this, ima fight shit, i'ma bite it, no one be listening my shit, you think that i'm done but this aint it, stalking my ex's on facebook, just to freak myself out and i hate it, i found someone new, for me to despise, she looks like you, but not behind the eyes, when i call her she smiles, where you cried, if you wanna save somebody, just cause somebody saved you, it doesnt always mean you'll have the conviction to, you know when i used to say, there's something wrong in my brain, i wasn't wrong i'm insane, there's something tapping the vein, i'm about to walk up to the park, at least one hour after dark, yeah - i know im fuckin hard, riding on my scooter with my helmet un done, tryna pop a wheelie but i didn't tell my mum, there's nothing to bite on, except my swollen gums, there's nothing to chew through, except you, tell me your problem, and i'll show you my guns, there's nothing to shoot through, except you, and i need you, more than i thought, somebody told me, it wasn't my fault, i didn't ask them, the why's and wherefores, and therefore... i never found out more, my shoulders feel tight when i'm writing, fight and flight becoming one thing, drawn to the ground like i'm lightning, somebody tell me who i'm fighting. the guest house mouse, childrens book about a mouse who lives under the cupboard in a tiny basement guest house, by the sea, alone. he lives off of looking super cute to the people visiting, who leave him enough crumbs to live off of for weeks between their visits. the cursory efforts of the cleaners only add to his luxury! as he enchants the hearts of many visitors, he will wait until they give him food and then show off his speedy and graceful, twisting dances! he has lived in the house for a very long time playing this fun and mutually cute/beneficial game, and lived a happy life. he has a bad leg, that makes him a little slow and limpy, maybe from falling down a long tower of pipes by this flats window, and landing in here to fend for himself. maybe originally he left a circus, as he is a wood mouse not a house mouse, but probably he just ended up here from a local park. roses are red, violets are blue... good luck finding someone, to tolerate you... you can sing better than i can, you can write better than i can, you can play better than i can, but at least you're not here to tell me i can't, wheres your compassion? i thought it was your fatal flaw... where is your talent? you always wanted so much more, than i could give, you always wanted so much more, than i could give, i hear the creak of shoo-ooes in the stone... the sound of a window pane being closed... i hear the ruu-uustle of clothes... the creak of a door as it opened and closed... i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. then they said, im'a tell you, i'm not a bad ghost, i'm not a bad man, but when i hear the clop of the boots on the marble floor, i feel like my soul has been taken. when we come here and, they kill our children, i'ma put off, and run. i'm sure it's not right on the face of it, but i'm going to get whats coming. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i'm really gonna miss the last of my kind. i can't seem to comprehend the thoughts inside my brain, it's all so foggy filled with the sound of rain, i'm so tired, in so much pain, all this mental progress gone down the drain, these feelings they remain. a good friend, is with you til the end, it's not all lies, just pretend, i thought we'd make it past the bend, but instead i bent u over and did u in ur rear end, i dont want to see your face, if you'll just drop it down next to me, up and down the street i pace, im telling you you've no respect for me, and of all the issues i've erased, and all the things that you pretend to be, you're infamous for your bad taste, must know already i'm the next to leave, so what did you expect from me, i waited so patiently... what could i have done differently, you can't really be expecting me? to believe, what you need, in reality, i cant see, any reason to take you seriously, you're so pretty, and so small, treat you shitty, cause i know it all, and i screened your call, i know i said i didnt, i just didnt think you had the brain cells to stop and fucking think a minute, but slow like a snail, you can't see, that you're creating these false needs for me. i take it flatteringly, but please leave. respect what i need, and just admit that you need me then leave. you made me throw my cereal in the bin, you made me make my own fucking decision, you made me miss the goddamn train, you wouldn't even sprint through the pouring rain, and now i'm in pain, somehow you're to blame, and if you just forgive me i promise i'll stay just to, do it again. and again. and again. burberrah baguheetie, doing some graffiti, pulls a can out her burberry bag, and draws a dick and teeties, exclaiming 'wow so preety, i love the womans teeties, if i was on twitch id give her all the bitties' well, humans do have hinges, they're just not, visible like fringes, hidden inside their skin, within this, a body says nothing but complains and winges, 'ohh dear me, i need some oranges', shut the fuck up, stomach, no, you're not gonna win this, knees and elbows folded back like a bin lid, what you talking about 'humans don't have hinges'? i spat out all the words, every one that i knew, seems that you just needed proof we couldn't live through you. what am i meant to do? what do i need to prove? how many fucking explanations flow right over the two? breaking boundaries and breaking the frame, forming ridiculous realities which know me by name, and every single careful statement that you attempt to claim, leaves me reeling, not kneeling, but feeling the pain. call it welfare check, it's more like break her neck, and you wonder why i open up with disrespect? fights for rights just gets us boots on heads, because if you're a little different, you're just something to wreck. and mon amour, left in shatters on the floor, she just wanted me secure, within this causeless war, an abusive use of force, you cannot prepare for, screaming, crying, but the door wont close anymore, you came for my safety, but you left with my trust, ripped it out of me like you were scouring off rust, and that's the kind of wound that might just never close up, bringing guns to a playground was a little fucked up. o cage, who

you? i did it! i feel it. i am happy! i know it. hey, whats up? i'm just a baby! i know it. i did it! i am happy! i know it. hiya, how are you? i am happy! i know it. i did it! i feel it, hey, hows it going? i am happy! i know it. i did it! i feel it, hiya! hows you? i'm just a baby! i feel it. i am happy! i know it. i did it!not what i'm for, i *did* know how i was gonna be, and i told you in advance, but what upsets me most, is that i could have been perfect and helped you all you needed, if you hadn't yelled at me. and honestly, im pretty offended that u dragged us away so fast, and then sat staring at me for ages, when i had already explained to you multiple occasions, that if i am stared at, i cannot move, but mainly cause i was finally comfortable enough to talk to people, dude, we were waiting for the train for 40 minutes, and there were 2 trains after it, it would have been better if you'd just gone and gotten it if you were so worried, i missed my only opportunity to talk to his mum, and his friends, because of your behaviour, and i never asked you to feel that way. in fact, i (on multiple occasions prior to and during the event) asked you to not focus on me and worry about yourself, if i needed help i'd've asked for it, what i needed was freedom, and i asked for it, and wasnt given it, like, if i had to be honest, you kind of 'ruined' my whole experience of that memorial, i dont hold that against you, and id never bring that up in anger, but your anxiety and constant checking on me and stuff really made me unable to focus on my own grief, and then at the very end when i finally felt comfortable to express myself to people i was rushed away, and no, of course not, thats more of the same thing im complaining about kevin, i dont want you to involve yourself, i dont need your help, ive already fucking spoken to her on messenger because she reached out t ome, you're not the only person, im not expecting you to, i just mean, stop being like that, this, when this is literally one of the things im complaining about, like i dont understand how u cannot understand what im telling you, i know you struggle with communication, but im not sure what im missing here, i just dont know what im meant to do, i ask you to please not over involve urself because it was making my whole day horribly stressful, and u offer to contact custards' mum on my behalf!? like literally it was you talking to her on my behalf that was making me feel so tense and embarassed about the book!!! and we discussed that days ago!!! i just, i cannot get my head around it man, but theres 'how i think' and theres 'ignoring everything im told' literally tho, i told u that u contacting custard's mum on my behalf made me uncomfortable, and therefore, u suggest that u contact custard's mum on my behalf!?!?!? like, how is that not ignorance? its almost laughable and im not laughing at you, just, what!? what? i dont even say that anywhere near ur response, look what do u want from me, great, maybe figure that one out first, i dont even know what that means kevin, we're talking right now, reiterating, look, what do u expect me to fucking answer that with kevin, seriously, do you care about me, in what way? i can't live in this confusion much longer. honestly, i love you so much and i do not trust you at all right now. i appreciate your honesty and the effort you're willing to put in. i'm glad you want to make things right, and i'm hopeful therapy will be helpful for you. i wanna rebuild the trust that we had and improve our communication. there's something wrong between us, i notice that i spend nearly all the time we spend together dissociating heavily. it's not a pleasant feeling, but i believe it's bought on by anxiety or maybe ptsd stuff, and it's probably crucial we address it. i also want us to be clear on our boundaries moving forward. it's important for both of us to trust what the other person asks for instead of making our own decisions. i'd love to hear your thoughts on this too and what you think we can do to improve things. open communication is key to making this work. thank you for being so open about your feelings, i appreciate you. it does seem that you being around me is a trigger, or, that you being around me is a trigger for me to not eat properly, i actually cant tell which, if i don't eat and drink regularly on my meds they do more harm than good, tbh i cant ever follow it, i havent made it to water yet today. i've done pee and food tho. no i just have more extended time to fuck it up, i mean, ukmmm, i can delay for longer, but the list still gets done, whereas if i delay a step for 3 hours whilst ur here, usually a load of other stuff happens in between, also u cant cope with me when i start to stop being medicated, cause im still not properly titrated so my meds only last 8 hours, and then i have what is literally a drug crash lol, which brings all my symptoms back tenfold, i just, i dunno waht to do cause i wanna care for you, but i dont know how, it even got down to stupid stuff like when we were having intimacy id be like wiggling myself into a position that was actually nice for me and you'd move me back like 4 times. which i get is because i didnt speak verbally about it. but im not sure how to make our communicatin any better! as you often say 'we're just too different' thats

they had to spend hours carving away at rotten wood to give their home - sorry, their hero cave - a semblance of home. they even found themselves something very rare for a mouse, at least, for a free mouse: a name. most of their kind never worried about names, they didn't need them. but those two had the most peculiar fascination for the human world far above their head. so, one day, they attached those little markers above their respective beds. and used them as their names ever since. you cannot begin to imagine the look on everyone's face when they both stood, fierce and strong, and refused the accustomed introduction and matinal greeting in favour of using their newly minted names! twenty-six mice fell over from shock! or a very strong gust of wind. two decided to reject tradition, eloped that instant, and left town. some old sage even swears she heard the death of mice that very day, sharpening her scythe. of course, if you ask her, she was doing no such thing, and, by the way, they only freed the remains, and would never hurt a mouse. and whoever told you she doesn't appreciate the creatures she's been given to care over is a liar, and a fraud. death has never been one to shun life. she works tirelessly to make sure every mouse is safe, and doesn't go before their time. it is a hard job, but one she gladly does. and the official record is very clear, no mouse died, some just gained a name. let me give you a tour of their little house, as it was all they had left now. it has a door made of bark, and moss. the moss used to be a vibrant green when they first set their eyes on it, and decided to use it as a door. now, it was a bit brown. a lack of proper hydration, and friction, despite the amazing engineering that was involved in making this rough piece of bark as a door. as far as it being but a prototype, it was very well crafted, through and through. ohh, the feats of mechanics and bending of the very rules of physics those two could do! when you sled that door open, you would get hit by a gust of warm air, they liked a bit of warmth, and this house was, by far, the cosiest in town. it was all thanks to a very crafty system made entirely from reclaimed wood from older projects, that would heat air over a very small heat source. in this house, it was usually a light well, heating up a container of water through a system of mirrors and lenses - and when that didn't work, plain old exercise, a mouse wheel. if you wish. said wheel was all you would see just on the side of the entrance, and then, it would go on to the kitchen, a pantry, all in a row, this little room they built for their craft projects, and a giant living room, nearly a metre in length. but the one room that made our two friends here the happiest was by far the bedroom. they had managed, through a pretty lucky occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the roughest fabric went, of course, to their engineering projects. and the bedroom was one of those. the lights shut with pulleys, the bed rose to the ceiling to make place for a big table on which they often read correspondence from all over the mouse's craftiests. by the standards of most, they were very smart, but so lazy as to rely on technology instead of physical work. by the standards of their peers, they were some of the craftiest and craziest mice around. most of their day was spent in between stacks of letters, endless craft projects and, occasionally, at night, their very fancy bed. atop that bed sat those two beautifully crafted pieces of fabric. the first one was orange, it belonged now to the oldest of the pair, who was slower on his feets, with big ideas that took him ages to think of, and even longer to draft and explain. on that orange patch was, in petrol blue thread, written the name angle. the next one, full of blue and purple, had a beautiful embroidery, only the end of which was ever found. it belonged to droid, a very energetic mouse, with no less than a million brilliant ideas in his head at all times. he could solve most problems that he came across, if he wasn't distracted by a nice piece of cheese, or the idea for his newest cheese cutting machine. they were considered very eccentric, even for inventors, and the huge pile of schematics probably didn't help them get that idea off of people's minds. it was all around, on the central round table - it turned, although, at this point, nobody remembered if it was on purpose or not - on a pile off the wall, hung up on said wall too! a few even ended up used as a couch, once they realised it was possible to make paper support their weight by bending it correctly. the living room was not very, well, liveable, in comparison. it was full of materials, some useful, some trinkets, and finished projects ordered by the mice around. for everyone complaining about the duo's laziness, they sure liked to get them to solve their everyday problems. one wanted sharp knives forever, the next one wanted a warm plush for their child. and ten of them wanted tools for the farm. it was their busy life as wood mice. they liked their house, and their life, it wasn't very fulfilling for their brain, but they really liked the mice in their little town. but, of course, all of that didn't really matter much to them right now. they were lost. their house was in shambles, and, as calm as it had gotten, they felt things were in movement around them. bad things. and so, they worked tirelessly through the end of the night to hide their living arrangements from nosey humans. got rid of their schematics, dismantled the inventions, and finally, came time to remove the two patches of fabric, and turn those into their travel pouches. they scurried out the door right as two huge hands approached to pick up their log and throw itats!

everyone just books their own holidays these days haha. my fiancee has literally run away. he hitchhiked to reading and is staying with family. didnt let me know for 48 hours of literally solid crying. because i told him to clean the room before his mates came over. literally. he just left and turned his phone off he is a proper dickhead. yeah i just thought i'd message u rather than put that up on facebook. i hope its a fucking misunderstanding. pretty boring. just working working etc. but my entire life is just stress with him anyway! yeah i still am lmao. doing admin. and because we just fight all the time. nah im not sure it's worth it tbh. and nah still boring haha. what u doing now? and yeah i dont get him at all. we're both going through shit at the moment but to just up and leave? enjoying it still? no idea. i guess just wait till he contacts me like a little bitch. nothing else i can do but play his game. because i love him ridiculously. and i have my own flat so i'm just staying on my own. he has no keys ;) is it too personal to ask what happened with kevin? omg now i feel bad. wait ur in tenerife!? awesome i'm jealous! sigh, what a bitch. umm, was it yours in the end? yeah? if so that is so awful. well i suppose at least your life doesn't have to get dragged down by it, no offence haha. stuck with a bitch like that. haha. haven't seen her for yeeears, but she was always a bit weird. yep! i caused a baby. weirdness. haha i knpw. nah just working now. gotta have money to pay all of kevins rent for him! he doesn't have a job lol. nope. lost it 4 months ago. pretty much yeah. just feels weird being alone. my new boyfriend haha. so does he. he moved as i was selfieing doesn't make for a good selfie. so cute and then suddenly licking his balls. i'll stop with the cat pics but i truly have nothing better to do. yeah i lick me butt and all. omg have u seen my tattoo? that's my leg bottom of pic is knee. yeah i love it. i'm totally not obsessed with cats... you have any? i just went for it like ima do it. i just want more now :( i want the stereo typical girl tattoo of flower on wrist/arm area. what do u want? haha so i want stereo typical girl and you want stereo typical guy? typical. haha. aww big daddy was the cutest film. i'm trying to watch stupid comedies lol. sigh i should probably sleep even i have work nooo. 11 actually i'm chill. thought it was 9. you working tomorrow? ohh shit. you with family or? i just forgot haha. haven't been on holiday in timeee. not since i went amsterdam in november (lol and got awkwardly proposed to) we were in an old recording studio, he wanted to set up to record it and be all cute and stuff. but we weren't allowed to touch the equipment and there were just two old guys in the back just like why the fuck are these people here and then he just went ahead and did it anyway, i pretended to be happy, and then we went and smoked and i cried. lmaooo. the rest of the holiday was fab though. tmi but posh hotel room sex on mushrooms... i recommend it... haha! it was designed to be lovely but it all just went wrong. and i dunno just, happy happy happyyy. omg actually giant bath with glitter bombs before hand was better haha. well i wasn't at the time lmao. that would have beenmenon - but others propose this subjective measure of dissonance can be affected by training of the brain and ear. frances discusses this idea of subjective interpretation, saying in regards to supposed good tonal articulation that 'it remains for us to prove why such a tonal articulation is in fact the best; why in all likelihood it is not a requirement of every human ear' (francès, 1988). nature vs nurture - zentner and kagan address this conflict between nature and nurture with studies on infants reactions to consonance and dissonance, concluding that infants seemed to prefer consonant tones. - after-eight-step sequencer build video script - intro - about a year ago, i made a video about my first ever electronics project - a granular synthesizer called the auduino. at the end of that video, i promised i'd be back soon with another project - a sequencer this time! after spending an entire year inside dealing with multiple failed builds, learning to code, and literal explosions... here it is! the after-eight-step is a machine learning enhanced sequencer built using arduino and max. it builds off the typical baby-8 style of diy analogue sequencers, first documented by kevin magnier back in the 90s. typically, analogue sequencers will take several pitch inputs and repeat them infinitely. the secret behind my after-eight-step sequencer is the addition of markov chains. markov chains control how the sequencer moves between steps, meaning i can set the device up to intelligently write its own music inspired by the information i give it. connecting analogue sensors via an arduino allows for a tremendous amount of customisation in code, meaning the physical system could be adapted to many projects. the after-eight-step has two chains; one writes its own melodies generated only from the sequencers pitches. the other has probability values that can be manually tweaked to create interesting new patterns.why am i doing thistraditionally, sequencers are very repetitive. this sounds great in many situations, such as new orders blue monday, which uses a sequencer to great effect, and a diy one at that! however, this looping nature is also a significant limitation if you want to create the more evolving elements of songs. i want to bring the idea of analogue sequencers to more modern technology, allowing experimentation with the new possibilities microcontrollers can bring to music production and sound synthesis. i've createdhe bedroom. they had managed, through a pretty lucky occurrence, to get their hands on silk, and the most soft felt, and a huge patch of a dreamy wool. as they managed to find such treasures, they were the ones to keep it all, but, in their habitual fashion, they had given most of it away, after making warm blankets, aprons, ear warmers and little gloves. some of the roughest fabric went, of course, to their engineering projects. and the bedroom was one of those. the lights shut with pulleys, the bed rose to the ceiling to make placwhen is your birthday? its in may!

(i'm a bit of a crochet newbie) thanks for any help you can give! i've recently collaborated with a friend of mine in creating a music video - he produced the entire song and i filmed and edited the visuals. until recently i thought that i was going to upload this to my channel, and he was not at the time running a youtube channel to showcase his music at all. now that i've finished it, he's saying that he would really like to upload it to his channel too as he really likes it. i don't really have an actual problem with that, other than a silly feeling that it would 'look weird' to be double uploaded, but i am under the impression that a duplicate upload would be against youtubes terms of service? or even that one of them would be automatically taken down? what do people tend to do in these kinds of cases? i've tried to google to not much avail, and when i've looked at music videos they tend to only be uploaded to either the musicians or the directors channel - not both. this might be a bit of an odd question, but i've been trying to search for an answer to it and can't find any conclusion/mention of this. i'm receiving my boundless cfx (first vape) tomorrow and i have read everywhere that it, at first, has a strong plastic taste. i know this is going to put me off of using it, and have also read that the taste doesn't really go away from burnoffs alone and you need to use it a couple of times. if i were to pack the bowl with vape or some cooking herb (would it have to be dried?), would that spoil the vape or clean the taste out? i can't figure it out. again sorry if this is a bit of a stupid question. edit: ended up with the tinymight, was thinking i'd want a mighty as well but nope. this thing is amazing! thanks to the people who recommended it (and to everyone else for helping) when i smoked joints, i'd convinced myself to only smoke outside whilst doing a longish walk. now i've finally properly converted to vaping after 4 years of trying, i'm losing all my fitness. i don't really care but it'd be cool to have something i found good outside. (also i'd love to be able to 'smoke' on the way to places again rather than having hour long seshes at home only.) question:i'm looking for either recommendations for a new vape that would hit my requirements, or advice on how to make any of the ones i have better for the outside world? price range: fairly open number of participants: 1 desktop, portable or pocket size: portable/pocket size electric or butane powered: probably electric frequency of usage: daily country/region: uk - i currently daily use the **boundless cfx with a water pipe adapter and an upright bubbler**. this is perfect and works really well for me (except the fact it gives me headaches because i'm not leaving enough time between tokes) - but i've already broken 1 bubbler and i can't imagine taking the 30cm high beast out on a walk with me. i would use this outside more often but i'm really not a fan of the stock mouth piece, it's impossible to clean - and the vapor is so much nicer through water. i also have the **dynavap omni 2021**, which is awesome but i think looks like a crack pipe when i'm out and about. it also takes forever to heat outdoors, and requires too much concentration. the induction heater (orion) that i have's battery is too shit to use outdoors as it'll only do me one bowl and i tend to need a couple from the dyna. again, i also prefer this through water. and a **pax 3** which i never liked but should probably give another go. it's a real pain to clean too. - tldr: what vape is your favourite to use whilst on a walk? it doesn't have to be super discreet but i'd rather it just looked like a 'normal' vape/box mod rather than a crack pipe or a bing. **have you read the sidebar and rules(on this website (please do)** yes **what is your intended use for this build? the more details the better.** i want to use it largely for photo/video editing (adobe photoshop/premiere, lightbox, etc) and gaming (less graphics intensive stuff like civilisation, rimworld, ftl, etc - though i've been unable to play newer games for a while so may want to get into that. it's not a huge priority, though). i also use it with a steam controller and wireless keyboard, using largely a tv (hdmi) and a standard monitor, if that matters any. **if gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (screen resolution, framerate, game settings)** working. not crashing. don't care too much about graphics. mid settings are great, low settings are fine. just want it to work smoothly. **what is your budget (ballpark is okay)?** as i am unsure what needs upgrading, i am unsure. would depend on the parts. i am certainly in a mid-to-low-range budget in general, as a student, but would be happier to pay a higher amount to upgrade one important part of hardware. though it can probably be said it's unlikely i'd be able to spend more than £10 tops on a part, but i can upgrade in stages. **in what country are you purchasing your parts?** uk **post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). consider formatting your parts list.(on this website don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**. sorry for not formatting using pcpartpicker! a lot of my components weren't listed on there. this is the current parts list of my pc; cpu: amd fx-4100 quad-core processor (3.6ghz) memory: 8gb (2x4gb - unknown brand) gpu: amd radeon hd 6700 series (1gb dedicated memory, 4gb total memory) storage: 500gb disk drive operating system: windows 10 i feel really out of the loop in terms of pc building, i don't know what i need any more. i had some ideas for upgrades; cpu: amd fx 8350 black edition "vishera" cpu (8 core, am3+, clock 4.0 ghz, turbo 4.2 ghz, 8 mb l3 cache, 125 w) memory: corsair cmk16gx4m2b300​0c15 vengeance lpx 16 gb (2 x 8 gb) ddr4 3000 mhz cl15 xmp 2.0 gpu: evga geforce gtx 1060 sc gaming, acx 2.0 (single fan), 6gb gddr5, dx12 osd support (pxoc) storage: samsung 850 evo 500 gb 2.5 inch solid state drive **provide any additional details you wish below.** do those upgrade parts make sense? what is most urgent to upgrade? things are responding slowly even in windows, i've fresh installed it a few times to try to combat this but it seems to struggle with the programs i want to use. it's perfectly usable but i'd like to be using it a lot more often, and it's currently performing worse than my surface 3 which isn't a nice benchmark. **note: you do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. please do not ask to simply be given a build. you arn to your weed, we would like kevin's voice!

- charis cat - the kenbak-1 was the first ever personal computer, released in 1971 and able to complete a variety of complex mathematical equations using binary input. this stunning full-size recreation by kevintronic pays homage to the incredibly rare collectable original with this 50 piece limited run of their kenbak-1 replica. kevintronic have gone above and beyond to ensure this replica is as accurate as possible. in striving to create this precise remake they contacted the manufacturers of the originals outer shell, and were told that the case had been discontinued in the early 80s! the maker was ever hopeful, and asked for a limited run of the cases to be created but was sadly denied. thankfully, the manufacturers were more than happy to share the original engineering drawings which kevintronic took to a local metal shop to have recreated. this hard work and dedication shine through in the final product, a thoughtful recreation of an essential aspect of computing histor why. having sold a micro and a nano version of this in the past, it's clear that kevintronic know their stuff. operated by an atmel processor, this more straightforward and modernised circuit runs the same way as the original kenbak-1. it even has enhancements ranging from a real-time clock to a usb connection, which allows for uploading or downloading code. kevintronic is an independent electronics company based in minnesota, usa, and has been selling their recreations since 2018. - 2021-11-23 - arduino synthesiser!

- 2021-11-11 - eurorack mixer for seven signal summing! - charis cat - if you're building a eurorack modular synthesiser, you'll know you always need more methods of creating novel voltage ramps. using the eurorack mixer, you can combine and attenuate up to 7 input signals to create your own interesting and complex control shapes! inspired by the current electronics shortage, the mixer arrives fully assembled and is 1board version a little hard to control due to the potentiometers often falling out of the breadboard, but i was more than happy with how the circuitry worked and was excited to continue expanding this project. after this successful breadboarding, i decided to create a more permanent hard- soldered prototype. due to my relative inexperience with soldering, choice of a metal case, and the large number of parts in the project - this proved more difficult than i expected and became a significant issue. system evaluation 4 - although the soldered version would often seem to work fine, the arduino nano that i connected it to had a resistor blow as well as my laptop repeatedly saying that the usb device was drawing too much power - indicating that there were short circuits somewhere within the circuit. the screen also did not seem to be working despite me thinking that it had been wired up identically to the breadboard. the ways it was not working were also rather odd; some of the data (such as the starting message) would show up, but then it would struggle to keep the data on the screen. with significant irritation; i decided that to present a working prototype at the end of the module, i would have to go back to the breadboard. i spent some time tidying it up so that the leds were more 'readable', and also noticed the screen issues disappear. the potentiometer inputs are significantly noisier when put through the breadboard than their soldered counterparts, but they do not seem to be having the same issue with short-circuiting. one of the major things that i learned during this projects confidence! it broke her heart! the music went, droid knew how to avoid trouble. it broke the cupboard door, droid walked, you found your way back through the woods! they looked towards their left, it touched the branches moving, angle walked right over it. they knew things! i mumbled to her! droid listened to the wood mouse talk, for a long time, and, well, she broke my heart! we broke angle's heart, he knew to warn the mouse! you lost your things. elodie fell on it, they yelled it at him, they told angle the truth! droid lost her stability, angle found safety! she called out for droid! you ran it! android lost her way home, it smelled the air, she walked over, you walked for one or two hours! they found a stuff!

he had it, right? droid knew what footsteps sounded like. he called things out! angle felt the leaves underfoot. the wood mice tripped over the door! droid knew that there were two of her, two mice, not just one alone. he tripped and fell through the door! they found their way back! they whispered it in elodie ear, we loved droid, he felt the house shaking! you mumbled to him, she loved the other wood mice! the wood mouse hid in the woods! i felt the warm air! kevin had the map! geepy answered you, the wood mouse thought about things! it was so cold, they walked into the woods! you were a tiny little wood mouse! angle broke her heart. it told the mouse things!

i felt the cats, he had soft green moss! we fell off it, it noticed a perfect hiding spot. he fell from it! angle lost her things, it took hours, but we fixed it, angle broke an invention, you knew the cats, she was a tiny little wood mouse, she was just a tiny little wood mouse. it loved its house, and she chose to stay safe, you hid and slept for a few hours, they made an invention! it built two things, we forgot to look, so we fell down into that pipe! i walked right! you fell right through, it told the mouse the truth, he had four hours! it answered you. it realised it was safe! charis remembered to be strong! they knew that they should warn her! i loved helping people. it did great, you were just a wood mouse, he was on an adventure, i hid under there! they lost their comfort! somebody crawled through it! droid looked above her, she had this thing! we crawled it! charis darted down the pipe! angle fell off of a pipe! he thought it, angle was alone in the cupboard! she had about two hours! they loved green moss, you knew to warn them, she walked there, he yelled it at them! a cat built a thing, she knew the rain, angle knew when to take risks. droid needed to keep going, but they fixed it, right? i had about two hours! she made a map, you fell, they stood there! angle knew how to make a friend. angle did great, angle loved her things, kevin told him the truth, it took hours, but the booflord fixed it, he did something very brave, he mumbled to me, she remembered it, elodie felt the daylight! the mouse was cute, the wood mouse was resourceful. you looked up. the wood mouse felt warm! the mouse had something! the wood mouse fell. you knew how to make the mouse feel safe. she knew the darkness! they had a tail! i was a tiny baby mouse. droid needed a plan! it did fall down, they were just a wood mouse! he remembered the plan! we felt the soft green moss! she walked into the woods, she touched the bark door, i fell right in!

angle fixed the tapestries, she chose to keep going, i had some moss, it made a schematic! he felt warm! he mumbled to himself and said 'i'm just a mouse...' we understood how to help, she was about to have an adventure! he had about an hour! we loved things! he looked ahead, angle felt like she was on an adventure, and it hit her all at once as she remembered how she hurt her leg because she fell through a pipe, it liked the soft moss. he missed his home. angle said 'hello!'! he looked below himself, they walked down it! she crawled through it! she answered the spider, but droid hadn't noticed the mouse trap, or the spider, and the fact that they had claws!! angle shouted at me!

this is the worst kevins in the shower, i dunno why now tbh, but thats whats happening, i dunno, she siad she was gonna shower at 5 to for some reoasn, why do they keep contradicting themselves, i literally mainly wanna know why they've lied so much. literally have an email from them saying no speakers in the room, fucks sake sorry, im british and autistic i have no idea how to do this bahaha, yeah that did not make me wanna come any more ol, *lol, how are u feelin? i feel like ima just have a really socially bad time lmfao, apparently not lol they're acting like i tore the whole thing apart i dunno, i know people who love me love me, but thats not sass and tim lol, like he was all 'you know you asked to play right?' like, ok, cause u asked me to play :/ sounds like he wants me not to play, what the fuck lol, sorry lol my doctor just told me there's 'no way you're going to see a psychiatrist' when i told them my mental health was bad and group anxiety sessions after a 12 week waiting list starting today probably wasnt enough, and uni have officially said if i cant come in this week cause of my ankle i'm expelled love uuu, yeah they said i have to try this first, i literally started cracking up laughing cause i was so done and they hung up on me lmao, dont worry dont worry im just explaining my extreme spicyness, i think i might have to make the decision for my mh to cancel fr tbh - but i'm still thinking about it so i'm not gonna say that publically, the last time i came back from america it was so traumatic i spent literally 3 months not sleeping bahahaha and im barely over it i dunno if its worth it, love u plz enjoy ur night, also sorry for delayed high vibes timings, been trying to think of a time but brain doing a stresso, honestly wish i could be more clarity about it, i wanna cancel so bad but i wanna see everyone so bad and - well - it just makes my tummy hurt lol, irrelevant: (((i looked up the prices for campinn and was like ok waaaow. they've sold out of everything except vip, but vip bedroom with a balcony nd shit is £1000 and comes with three tickets and two beds. why is fam reunion so expensive ))) yeah probably, im not cancelling yet, and i cant cancel my flights only postpone, and it worried me when they said they plan to go out every night cause lol i dont have money for that, sounded like i wasnt invited anyway tbh, me too and i'm mad, what did either of us even do wrong, i specifically didn't pass any of my email through kevin cause i knew they were gonna blame her for 'influencing' me - i got kevin to check it and she said it was more than reasonable, and she's been saying to me a lot 'it feels like i'm just paying to come to an event and be left out' and now i feel like i'm in that position too. why would i wanna come. i don't get why she's still coming. yeah i am annoyed with her about that but i havent said anything to her, theres no event without artists, if we stopped just going along with this shit maybe they'd realise they'd done something wrong, but i dunno if it was just me but felt like that whole call was just trying to get me to cancel. kinda butthurt about tim saying 'you know that you did ask to play, right' fuck off lmfao, i may have still been speaking, i missed some of what people were saying whilst i was talking cause i got stuck in a stutter lol, yeah legit :/ it was never meant as a personal attack, i was just laying out how everyone felt, i dont even know sass. when she says 'what reason have i, saosan, given you to not trust me' - the answer is nothing!! but what have you given me to trust you? i dont know you! and all we've had so far is secrecy and lies, i dont not trust her as a person. but i dont trust a secret entity that may or may not be her or tim or some other third party no name signature on a lying email, yk maybe if we saw a cv of these '31 other events with the exact same business model' i really wanted to shout to tim what business model when he said that, because legit, what thirty one other groups are just like a twitch fam???!?!?!? i cant think of any, and i dunno if i wanna support an event run by someone whos that delusional, it just feels... i dunno... i wanna be there and see everyone, it feels like a baaad idea to do this event unless everyone just still wants tim to be paying them on twitch and shit, and lying that hes a famous dj, sorry sorry sorry i should smink instead of spam you. sorry for deleting i got psyched out, i was sharing secret stuff he told me lmfao and i dont wanna seem like i'd tell secrets around just cause someone pissed me off, hope work isnt too bad, sigh i hope you get to go home soon, though it must be morning ish for you if its only 7pm here :( i know you wouldn't think that, i just felt a bit... i felt like he was even accusing me of contacting this guy i cant remember the name of lol, love you so muchchchchchc, exactly i had to google him lol, i was like 'looks annoying' lmao, i think the 'somebody contacted him' thing is a fabrication to get us all to look internally for a 'rat' tbh - but im clearly para about this event xd, whos this second one too then ? verano? i didnt realise she'd properly quit djing, aww that sucks, i wanna say all sorts of autistic things about trying different headphones but im sure she has her reasons, she always reminded me so much of my therapist hope shes okay, legend!! that's what i love to see, i hope i can get to the point i'm less scared to do things other than bass and tech house breakfast :d, all the props and respecc to her, love uuu, i cant come and i dont think ill be doing high vibes this weekend, gonna come off the internet for a while if i can manage it, yeah im freaking out a lot, and i just had a go at kevin, just giving off at her, i dunno the american word, words ofwho doesn't like bugs or doesn't eat animal products or whom has different taste buds to you. shh don't call me that in public all these comments are just making me want to take macro images of a dick. i know my boyfriend will never let me, though. it's why you buy them for £100 from the posh area, still get that saving as well as much lower likelihood of bed bugs. and just check the seams thoroughly when you get there. the second hand sofa i had still had the plastic covering on most of it except the cushions. like, why even? but i'd only do it for a sofa. anything cheaper than that is truly not worth the risk. worst mistake i made was putting a brand new memory foam mattress on a divan in a shitty apartment... :( well you're kind of wrong, the reason they posed seriously was because the shutter speeds weress. her partner, gone, all her comfort at home, gone, rain to make her freeze, very much not gone! at least, nobody was trying to capture her, for now. so, into the darkest corner she went, rolled into a ball, and sobbed, for the first time in hours! she felt responsible for her friend, and, above all, she was so, so scared. a tiny wood mouse in a giant city, that was all too much. all she wanted now was a berry to munch on, and a pile of old journals to fall asleep on - she loved reading their old exploration logs, even though she'd barely last a single page before starting to snore so loud passing children thought the house haunted for days! backing herself into the dark, in the tiniest recess in the wall, she invented an umbrella from a candy wrapper, her trusty cane, and a rubber band, hugged her pouch real tight, and drifted to sleep, right as the clock hit their hourly bells, in the dark of night. a few hours passed, and an orange glow started to engulf the roof, and was soon to arrive down towards droid. he got woken up quite abruptly by the original inhabitand even longer to draft and explain. on that orange patch was, in petrol blue thread, written the name angle. the next one, full of blue and purple, had a beautiful embroidery, only the end of which was ever found. it belonged to droid, a very energetic mouse, with no less than a million brilliant ideas in his head at all times. he could solve most problems that he came across, if he wasn't distracted by a nice piece of cheese, or the idea for his newest cheese cutting machine. they were considered very eccentric, even for inventors, and the huge pile of schematics
